This project presents a modern, data-driven framework for accurately predicting the soil Compression Index (Cc), a key parameter for settlement analysis and foundation design. Traditional oedometer testing requires 15–20 days per sample, while empirical equations—although quick—are often region-dependent and unable to capture the nonlinear behavior of natural soils. To overcome these limitations, this study evaluates widely used empirical equations alongside advanced machine learning models, specifically XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), using a dataset of 391 soil samples. Results show that ML models deliver significantly higher accuracy, with XGBoost achieving an R² of 0.9454 and an MAE of 0.0070, outperforming all empirical correlations. Overall, this project provides a fast, reliable, and generalizable solution for Cc prediction, bridging traditional geotechnical methods with modern machine learning techniques to support efficient and data-driven geotechnical decision-making.
